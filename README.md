# the3dsandwich.github.io

Repo for homepage hosted [here (the3dsandwich.github.io)](https://the3dsandwich.github.io)

Currently before I make up my mind of what to do with the root page, this simply redirects backe to my GitHub profile.

```sh
if anyone.ideas.exists("what_to_do_with_homepage")
   someone.do("submit_issue");
fi
```
